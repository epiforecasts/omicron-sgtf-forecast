1. Build case forecasts using a 2-strain model
2. Feed into hospitalisation forecast

### Aim 2: Estimate transmissibility

Steps:

1. Fit a model to a fixed (scaled) relationship between variants
2. Fit a model to a time-varying relationship between variants
3. Compare model fit by LOO to check the impact of allowing a flexible relationship between variants
