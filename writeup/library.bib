  abstract = {Infectious disease outbreaks are often characterized by the reproduction number R and exponential rate of growth r. R provides information about outbreak control and predicted final size, but estimating R is difficult, while r can often be estimated directly from incidence data. These quantities are linked by the generation interval \textendash{} the time between when an individual is infected by an infector, and when that infector was infected. It is often infeasible to obtain the exact shape of a generation-interval distribution, and to understand how this shape affects estimates of R. We show that estimating generation interval mean and variance provides insight into the relationship between R and r. We use examples based on Ebola, rabies and measles to explore approximations based on gamma-distributed generation intervals, and find that use of these simple approximations are often sufficient to capture the r\textendash R relationship and provide robust estimates of R.},

As the epidemic progresses, disease modellers continue to focus on estimating the basic reproductive number {$\mathscr{R}$}0 R 0 \textemdash the average number of secondary cases caused by a primary case in an otherwise susceptible population. The modelling approaches and resulting estimates of {$\mathscr{R}$}0 R 0  during the beginning of the outbreak vary widely, despite relying on similar data sources. Here, we present a statistical framework for comparing and combining different estimates of {$\mathscr{R}$}0 R 0  across a wide range of models by decomposing the basic reproductive number into three key quantities: the exponential growth rate, the mean generation interval and the generation-interval dispersion. We apply our framework to early estimates of {$\mathscr{R}$}0 R 0  for the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, showing that many {$\mathscr{R}$}0 R 0  estimates are overly confident. Our results emphasize the importance of propagating uncertainties in all components of {$\mathscr{R}$}0 R 0 , including the shape of the generation-interval distribution, in efforts to estimate {$\mathscr{R}$}0 R 0  at the outset of an epidemic.},

  abstract = {Background In May 2021, the Delta SARS-CoV-2 variant became dominant in the UK. This variant is associated with increased transmissibility compared to the Alpha variant that was previously dominant. To understand ongoing transmission and interventions, a key question is whether the Delta variant generation time (the time between infections in infector- infectee pairs) is typically shorter\textendash i.e., transmissions are happening more quickly\textendash or whether infected individuals simply generate more infections. Methods We analysed transmission data from a UK Health Security Agency household study. By fitting a mathematical transmission model to the data, we estimated the generation times for the Alpha and Delta variants. Results The mean intrinsic generation time (the generation time if there had been a constant supply of susceptibles throughout infection) was shorter for the Delta variant (4{$\cdot$}6 days, 95\% CrI 4{$\cdot$}0-5{$\cdot$}4 days) than the Alpha variant (5{$\cdot$}5 days, 95\% CrI 4{$\cdot$}6-6{$\cdot$}4 days), although within uncertainty ranges. However, there was a larger difference in the realised mean household generation time between the Delta (3{$\cdot$}2 days, 95\% CrI 2{$\cdot$}4-4{$\cdot$}2 days) and Alpha (4{$\cdot$}5 days, 95\% CrI 3{$\cdot$}7-5{$\cdot$}4 days) variants. This is because higher transmissibility led to faster susceptible depletion in households, in addition to the reduced intrinsic generation time. Conclusions The Delta variant transmits more quickly than previously circulating variants. This has implications for interventions such as contact tracing, testing and isolation, which are less effective if the virus is transmitted quickly. Epidemiological models of interventions should be updated to include the shorter generation time of the Delta variant.},
